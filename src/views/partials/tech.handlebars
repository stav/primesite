            Say goodbye to apps.
            Thanks to the all-new background process architecture, the
            browser can now be both safer and faster than native apps on
            your phone. Which means we don't need Google Play Store or Apple
            App Store any more, and of course, these new processes work on
            the desktop too since we're just using the web browser after all.

            Mobile-first is a smart style commitment
            not only because it is the fastest growing user agent market
            and of course all professional sites need to be responsive to
            different device sizes. It is smart because the limited space
            on a small view-port makes the screen real estate more valuable
            and therefore the user interface better by design.

            SPA's send everything to your browser in a single payload
            making user interaction lightning fast. Combined with Progressive
            Web technology you can even allow users to create database
            transactions while offline and have them committed later when
            the user attaches to the network.

            Whether you want to gather product information from all
            competitor websites or crawl the "entire" world wide web
            to have your own index similar to Google's or maybe you
            just want search engine results every day for mention of
            your name, we've got the tooling and infrastructure to get
            your bots out, crawling and bringing back the data.

            Bots are not just for checking Amazon prices anymore.
            Why use Amazon's website when you could use an interface that
            you actually love? And it would be great if you could use this
            same interface for every website. Well, we simply write a
            "middle-man" proxy bot that interactively deals with websites
            and displays the information for in in a common customized
            format.

            Everything we create can be served up seamlessly from our
            trusted servers, currently on Amazon AWS. This allows resources
            like network traffic to scale up automatically, incredibly high
            up-times and regional data-center locations allow specific
            geographical areas to be targeted for fast response times.
